Where his physical condition limited his movements, his creative writing opened up a new horizon that enabled him to freely interact with his readers.This is a real-life account of how a human being can overcome obstacles, giving effect to the epithet: 'What does not kill me makes me stronger.' The autobiography defines patience in two ways: first, as a bitter experience and then second, as the ability to tolerate and turn one\u2019s misfortune into investment. The accident that the writer suffered has paralysed his body, but at the same time it has unleashed his writing talents. (Yousef el-Sharoni, Egypt)141 PagesH/B"

        "description": "Ever since the time that Islam rose to spread its light across the middle East, North Africa, Spain and parts of Europe, the Christian church and the European rules have felt threatened, religiously and politically. Both the Christian missionaries and orientialist began studying Islam in order to spread lies and slander its teachings, and to let the people developa hatred and fear of Islam. They have even invented name-calling to slander the religion of Islam and Prophet Muhammad (s.a.w.w). Accordingly, any open-minded person embarking on a study of Islam and its histoy, especially if reading books written in European languages, should be aware of the apparently inherent misconceptions and distortions that permeate almost all non-Muslim writings on Islam. In the last year of the Twentieth Century, it does not seem that much has changed, even though most Muslims would agree"

It compared the origin of man from a religious perspective and concluded the most authentic account of the story of Adam. A critical analysis was done on the basis of the Theory of Evolution, Theistic Evolutionary Approaches, focusing on the Islamic perspective, to interpret the account of Adam mentioned in the religious texts. The study concluded that the non-methodological, inauthentic and contradicting attempts to interpret the religious account of Adam from an evolutionary perspective\u00a0were completely unsuccessful, affirming\u00a0miraculous creation of Adam as detailed in the Quran and authentic Sunnah."

Outside Arabia, the Persians and Byzantines keenly observed these developments, looking for an opportunity to crush the new state. Abu Bakr employed effective strategies to deal with these challenges and had remarkable success in doing so. Thus, he paved way for the Islamic conquests that toppled tyrants and carried the message of Islam to the entire world. His leadership should be a great source of"

Every word in the Quran was translated literally so that the reader could understand the meaning of every single word. It needs to be remembered that not all literal translation represents the exact meaning of the word since the Quran uses varied Arabic language style and sometimes metaphor. Accordingly, to understand the full or intended meaning of the word or the verse, Muhsin Khan's the Holy Quran Translation had been included in this edition. However, to comprehend more of the meaning of the Quran, reading the commentary of the Quran from trusted scholars would be necessary. Approved by the Department of Islamic Development of Malaysia"

She was highly learned and is considered to be one of the foremost scholars of the early Islamic period. She recorded the life of the Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) and, being a brilliant scholar and an excellent teacher, she explained it with intelligence and insight. Aisha (ra) narrated about 2200 ahadith, which is an amazing achievement for anyone. After the death of the Prophet Muhammad (pbuh), Aisha (ra) devoted most of her time to the propagation of Islam, making every effort to spread its message by teaching its tenets. She also took an active part in educational and social reforms. Aisha (ra) is undoubtedly an exemplary figure in the history of Islam and is an inspiration to all. ISBN :9788178987200 Author :Nafees"

        "description": "In our busy lives, Friday comes around once a week. It often comes and goes without our being really aware of it. For many Muslim men, it may be punctuated by the congregational prayer that we make special efforts to attend. For Muslim women, it may go by just like any other day. This ought not to be the case. In this special book, Dr. Gowher Yusuf gives us reason to stop and think about how special Friday (al-Jumu \u2018ah) really is, and what we should be doing to achieve the many bounteous blessings it holds for those who observe it. Friday is the day of congregational prayers for Muslims. The weekly gathering in mosques and the sermon serve as a medium of mass communication of messages that foster collective awareness about prevailing issues and focus on the societal affairs."

This book is far more than a biography, as it discusses major issues that have their origins in the early decades of Islam, the repercussions of which are still felt today. In this book, Dr Sallabi guides the reader through a myriad of hadiths and reports, peeling away the centuries-old layer of fabrications and distortions through which hostile elements both in the Muslim world and beyond sought to conceal the truth. What emerges is a clear picture of the first great turmoil that engulfed the Muslim world and how the noble companions and the members of his family worked together to resolve these momentous issues, following the guidance and teaching brought by the Messenger"

The author highlights many matters that have become common among Muslims even though they are clearly acts of shirk or associating partners with Allah. Not only is this book distinguished due to the importance of the subject matter but also due to the methodology adopted by the author for which he is well known. The reader will find that the majority of the book consists of verses of the Qur\u2019an, ahadith of the Prophet (s) and sayings of the early Muslims.

It is for this reason that this sin is the one sin that Allah has promised He will never forgive. Unfortunately many Muslims who are unaware of the reality of shirk fall into it out of ignorance. This short treatise is an ideal work for the Muslim in order to understand the essence of shirk, and thus essential reading for the one who wishes to avoid falling into the greatest trap of shaytan.

        "description": "6.5\"x9.5\" This edition consists of the second twenty ahadith of the Forty Hadith Nawawi. The forty hadiths that Imam An-Nawawi has collected, in this famous book, Al-Arba'un An- Nawawiyyah, have had tremendous importance and impact on the Muslim nation for many reasons. Firstly, these hadiths clearly make evident the unique way of speech which Allah has bestowed on His messenger, who confirmed this, when he said, \"I was given Fawati'ha Al-Kalam, wa Jawami'ahu wa Khawatimah (by Allah). This hadith indicates that Allah has given His messenger a type of speech which was very unique and extremely powerful, containing tremendous meanings, yet comprised of a few words."

This small treatise deals with the characteristics and descriptions of the Hypocrites with two extremely beneficial appendices. In the Qur\u2019an, Allah has revealed the machinations of the hypocrites, He has unveiled their beliefs, their qualities, and made their goals clear so that the believers can be aware of them. He divided mankind into three groups in the beginning of Surah al-Baqarah: the believer, the disbeliever, and the hypocrite. He mentioned four verses concerning the believers, two verses concerning the disbelievers, and thirteen verses concerning the hypocrites due to their plenitude and the"

At this late stage, even if we forbid them to have such a relationship, how certain are we that they will obey us if they are smitten by someone? Hence, it is important that we teach our children that the only time a girl or boy can have a relationship with a non-Mahram is when they are married! Furthermore, if a girl or boy enters into a girlfriend-boyfriend relationship then he/she is entering into a pre-marital relationship.Language: English"

It is debatable, however, whether the concept of free will is relevant in Muslim discourse or whether we should rather speak about your power to act and make independent choices in our lives, about the relationship of God's divine power and human power. But, then, we should also not speak about predestination, but the power of God to determine everything that happens in this world and the hereafter, the relationship of God's absolute sovereignty and human responsibility.

The purpose of these fataawaa is to give you some direction in your quest to seek knowledge and preserve it, but before mentioning the fataawaa we would like to mention a few statements of the salaf concerning knowledge and its tremendous merits."

Zarabozo With an Introduction by Prof. Jaafar Sheikh Idris.Here are just a few excerpts from Prof. Jaafar Sheikh Idris\u00a6s comments to the work. The reader will not be studying explanations of the hadith in a narrow sense; the reader will, in fact, be introduced to many branches of the Islamic sciences: the different sciences of hadith, the science of textual interpretation, the science of jurisprudence, law, and even Arabic language. This is a great commentary on a great book. Brother Jamaal Zarabozo is to be congratulated for producing such a scholarly book. --Prof. Jaafar Sheikh Idris T This commendable work offers a detailed analysis of forty of the most important hadith of the Prophet (S) for a Muslim to understand.

They did so by education, authorship, dialogue, and debate. Among the highly regarded books on this subject is The Creed of At-Tahawi of Imam Ab\u00fa Ja'far At-Tahawi (d. 321 A.H.). It is a very accurate and precise text, considering its small size. It includes the fundamental principles of belief and its most important issues. The commentary of the noble scholar 'Ali Ibn Abi Al-Izz Al-Dimashqi Al-Hanafi (d. 792 A.H.) on this book has obtained high stature, his explanation is adequate and in an easy to understand language. That is because it encompasses the true creed of"

Every Muslim is obliged to learn it and is promised protection from deviant beliefs by following the unassailable texts of the scholastic community of Islam. Of them all, The Creed of Imam al-Tahawi is the simplest, the most effective, and the least controversial. It serves as a sound basis for Islamic faith and is the most reliable of the early articulations of Muslim belief. Because Imam al-Tahawi avoided innovated theological issues and systematically presented the most fundamental aspects of dogmatic theology, his creed has achieved an unusual degree of acceptance in the Muslim world. In the thousand years since it was written, many great Muslim scholars have penned commentaries on it. It is"

But it is arguably more neglected than most personal duties performed by Muslims in the west. Many Muslims now live in lands where the majority of people know nothing about the message of Islam. Increasing numbers crave an alternative to the secular way of life, dominated by Capitalism, money and material wealth, with increasing social problems, and a spiritual vacuum.How did the Prophet Muhammad (sallalahu alayhi wa sallam) interact with them? What rights did he afford them and how did he give them da\u2019wah verbally as well as through his manners and character?Language: English"

The practitioner creates suction in a cup; the skin gets sucked up and rises under the cup as blood rushes up. Cupping is an ancient practice that has become increasingly available to the public. Although, it recently gained publicity in the western world and the United States, cupping is one of the most famous medical recommendations of Prophet Muhammad (Sallallaahu \u00c1layhi Wasallam). This book is an in-depth study of the medical importance of this great missing Prophetic recommendation that is found to be in perfect accord with modern medical science. It identifies and treats the basic tenets of this true faith in the light of current knowledge. It is written with the general as well as the specialized reader in mind. The"

But prayer in Islam is more than just an individual spiritual experience. It is meant to be performed in a congregation-the foundation of Muslim society as a whole.

Does it imply that Muslims are fatalists who see themselves as helpless in the hands of an indifferent fate? Attitudes towards the divine will and predestination have always influenced Muslims daily activities. In this book Dr. Umar S. al-Ashqar explores this topic in depth explaning it in clear terms for the ordinary Muslim. Drawing always on the Quran and Sunnah, and on the words of the greatest scholars such as Ibn Taymiyah, he covers some of the historical debates that took place within the ummah on this matter, explains the correct view, that of Ahl as-Sunnah wal Jamaah. The true Islamic concept of Divine Will and Predestination is an empowering notion."

Amongst these precepts are some very important, comprehensive principles that include the following points, which must be contemplated by every Muslim. - The truth, its importance to the Muslim, how he follows it and submits to it. - Lowly Desires (hawaa), and the reality of the continuing battle between the believer and his accompanying shaytaan\u2026and how a person is often directed by his hawaa! - Obedience, is the light of the believer, which he does not exchange"

The general principle is that: what is factual and rightful should be followed, not what is imposed on by false aspiration to divine injunctions or what rests merely on the usage of ancestors. In this context, the Qur\u2019an in (2:170) denotes: When it is said to"

Collected by Umar Quinn The science of the spiritual journey in Islam (*ilm al-sulak) is commonly called by many names, such as: steadfastness (al istigamab), servitude (al 'ubidiyyab), asceticism (al-zubd), self-purification (tazkiyyab al-nafs), and character reformation (tabdbib al akblaq). It is the migration of the soul to Allah and the Hereafter upon the path of the Noble Prophet (peace be upon him). It is the study of the states of the heart and their effects on behavior. Undoubtedly, the pious predecessors (al-Salaf al-Salib) and those who followed them in goodness were upon the wisest and safest approach to the spiritual journey in both knowledge and action. This volume serves as a primer on the subject,"

He has compiled hadiths (records of the guidance) of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and briefly commented on each. This well-researched and thoroughly documented book offers both Muslim and non-Muslim readers a clear understanding of how the divinely-inspired words and actions of Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him) apply to our contemporary societies. Such social ills as lying, greed, corruption, smoking, gambling and others have been discussed along with their social implications. After elaborating each issue, the author has offered wise and insightful advice to get rid of that particular social habit. In this beautifully-worded piece, his deep faith in Islam shines through along with his love and"

Imam al-Ajurri\u2019s kitab ularba` in Hadithan is among the earliest. It is a highly regarded text for Muslims to study and memorise, for it addresses fundamental aspects of religion, with particular focus on Creed, Pillars of Islam, the Halal and Haram as well as Piety and righteousness. Imam al-Ajurri originally compiled this work for the benefit of new Muslims, thus including within it, foundational essentials of the noble Islamic faith. The author may Allah have mercy upon him, has commented on each hadith, presenting the subject matter in a simplified way designed to assist readers in memorising the Prophetic narrations, and implementing what they learn in an easy manner.

Instead, the main goals of life are the fulfilment of carnal desires and the accumulation of material goods of no real substance for a trifling period of time, at the expense of following Divine guidance. The overwhelming prevalence of greed and vice is what destroyed the nations before and is an ominous sign that the Last Hour is drawing near. Despite living longer, people spend less and less time attending to their spiritual needs, choosing instead to focus their attention on the myriad distractions made possible by fast-evolving technology. Beguiled by the false allure of this world the souls become diseased and ultimately die."

From the book (i.e., excerpt): Eemaan is named so because it is connected to the inner affairs; and Allaah, the Majestic and High, knows them. Hence, it is called Eemaan because it is connected to the truthful heart. There are, for this truthful heart, outward affairs as an indication of one\u2019s sincerity and the soundness of its faith. If the true Muslim displays them, is upright upon them, and performs them then this is proof for the soundness of his Eemaan. He who is not upright, that is an indication of the lack of Eemaan or weakness in his Eemaan. Eemaan\u2014in its general sense\u2014Islaam enters into it, and vice-versa."

        "description": "Arabic-English Dictionary A Compact Version of the Internationally Recognized Fourth Edition This dictionary presents the vocabulary and phraseology of modern written Arabic. It is based on the form of the language which, throughout the Arab world from Iraq to Morocco, is found in the prose of books, newspapers, periodicals, and letters. This form is also employed in formal public address, over radio and television, and in religious ceremonial.

And what is the relationship between them and us anyway? Surely by Allah, this is destruction, but it is not due"

Every Muslim is commanded to learn his deen (religion) in general and these porhibitions in particular. The Qur'an and Sunnah commands are definitely for virtues and their prohibitions are surely malicious deeds that a Muslim should avoid in his everyday life. Allah and His Messenger have prohibited everything that contains any sort of harm or evil. These prohibitions vary in their degree of evil. They are either haram (un-allowed) or makrooh (abominable) sins, which are also un-allowed even if their degree of evil is less than that of the haram ones; and a true Muslim should avoid both. This valuable book of al-Munajjid, like his previous book (Muharramat), is a good approach toward understanding these prohibitions of Islam and seeking the ways to avoid them. 57 Pages"

O believer, this world is not meant to be your paradise, but knowing that Paradise awaits, makes this journey so much more bearable and rewarding. Remember that every difficulty is a right, after all your struggles, all your tests, and trials know that your eternal sanctuary awaits. Jannah, that is built by your deeds and decorated by your du'as. Chalets of crystals sparkling on the horizon for a soul that gave up sin, tree trunks of green emerald and branches of gold for a simple word of remembrance. Each of your shuddering breaths, every second of discomfort you faced, and every one of your sacrifices,"

The psychologists emphasize the necessity of love in the human life and the need for every human being to love and feel the love of someone else. They assert that this human need is the foundation of rest of mind for an individual. \u00a0 But how can one sustain affection throughout the years of marriage? What makes some people happy in their marriages while others fine marriage miserable? What is the real love that should prevail in every marital relationship? And what are the rights of the spouses on each other? \u00a0 By Allah\u2019s permission \u2013 this book provides comprehensive answers to these questions, compiled from a number of sources"

        "description": "The message of the Qur'an is addressed to all creation, conveyed in the Arabic language. Allah Almighty says: \"We have sent it down as an Arabic Qur'an so that you may understand.\" (12:2) Acquiring command over the Arabic language can be relatively easy for those who are native speakers, but can prove difficult for the non-speakers. The study of Arabic, therefore, cannot be taken lightly. The books that can impart knowledge of the Qur'anic Arabic are rare. The present book is specifically designed for learning the language of the Qur'an. All examples used in the explanation of Arabic grammar have been taken straight from the Holy Qur'an. This approach aids the beginning -student to enter the world of the Qur'an, allowing simultaneous understanding of Arabic grammar and the Qur'an, which is a very special feature of this book.

        "description": "This book is a compilation of two treatises from Imaam Muhammad bin Saalih Al-\u2018Uthaimeen, may Allaah have mercy on him, both on the subject of Fasting and Ramadaan. The first book, though small in size, contains numerous beneficial points. It is divided up into eight sections, which were designed to serve as lessons on distinct topics commonly talked about during the month of Ramadaan. The second book is a collection of questions and answers on fasting, which were recorded, transcribed and later published in Arabic with the approval of Imaam Ibn \u2018Uthaimeen. It is helpful as well since it covers and provides answers to many everyday situations that one encounters while fasting. Both of these treatises can be found on the author\u2019s website www.binothaimeen.org, along with many more of his valuable works. Additionally, the Arabic text for all Qur\u2019aanic ayaat"

The author explains the reasons which prompts and results in many people falling into this trap. The main motive behind this summarized work is to correct what is heard from people, some claiming to be students of knowledge, quoting and giving references from fabricated traditions of the Prophet (SAW). Others establish their religious duties and seek closeness to Allah by basing their activities on fabricated traditions without any authorized links proving their attribution to the Prophet (SAW). He also sheds some light on the Islamic ruling upon people who lie against the Prophet (SAW)."

        "description": "According to the religion of Islam, martyrdom in the path of the God is from the greatest of deeds, the reward for which is no less than Paradise. Whereas suicide, On the other hand, is from the most reprehensible of deeds, the reward for which is no less than hellfire. In the history of Islam, the learned men and women of the faith have never confused the two. It is only with the proliferation of suicide bombing in our time that the clear distinction between suicide and martyrdom has become marred. Greatly expanded and updated from its controversy-causing first draft, this book candidly tackles the emotive topic of suicide bombing head-on from the perspective of the orthodox practicing Muslim. The result makes for a highly effective counter-radicalisation tool as well as offering a unique insight into the ethos of jihad."

Sheikh al-Munajjid. has dealt with matters such as calling for help from sheikhs, saints and things other than Allah; worshipping the dead and circumambulating their graves; invoking prophets, using magic and fortune-telling and believing in astrologists and planets, etc.As such, this book of prohibitions in beliefs and worship acts is a must to almost every Muslim, if he/she is really practicing Islam and wants to be safe and free of great sins."

Did Jesus order future generations to follow him? Does the Bible describe him and his message? If you have been contemplating these questions, you will find answers in this book. It will shock you, soothe you, make you cry, but most of all it will educate you. Ignorance begets fear, and fear begets hate.

The voluntary \"night prayer\", or qiyaam, is indispensable for a person's moral, spiritual, and physical welfare. Yet, it is greatly misunderstood and largely neglected by most Muslims. This is why we present this book, with two main objectives: (1) Provide a complete guide on the subject of qiyaam and related issues, in accordance with the Qur'aan, the Sunnah, and the guidance of the Salaf. (2) Present to the reader, in the process, two important works by the prominent scholar Muhammad Naasir ud-Deen al-Albaani (may Allaah bless him): \"Salat ut-Taraaweeh\""

This man was a towering personality who excelled in many diverse fields; as statesman, general, teacher, lawmaker, social reformer, exemplary father and husband.

When they transgressed against their Lord, belligerent nations came to witness agonising recompense, while those who belittled sins and insisted on committing them further hastened and increased the ferocity of their torment on earth. A Muslim is therefore, always fearful of any wrongdoing he falls into and is swift in turning back to Allah in repentance. \u201cMany are the towns whose end We delayed while they did wrong, then We seized them.

This includes persevering throughout the ordeal, not complaining about one\u2019s\u00a0condition (except to Allah) and recognising that Allah\u2019s wisdom and decree necessitate\u00a0holding good positive thoughts about Him. \u00a0 Allah, the Most High, presses the believers to seek His assistance through patience and\u00a0prayer. It is a realisation that Allah doesn\u2019t put you through hardship except to grant\u00a0you relief, nor place a burden on you more than you can bear. To know"

He successfully taught and conveyed the Message of Allah to the people of Arabia and thereby transformed the pagans of the entire Arabian Peninsula into staunch believers in the unity of Allah within twenty three years of his own lifetime. Even though he was chased out of his hometown, Makkah as an outcast, he established a state in Madinah and returned to Makkah to conquer it peacefully. The after-effects of his Prophetic vision and teachings contributed to the emergence of a new world order and civilisation that changed the course"

His message and prophethood were challenged by the polytheistic society in Makkah, urging him and his few followers to emigrate to Madinah. Despite his illiteracy, he conveyed Allah's Book, the Noble Qur'an to mankind, teaching them endless values and principles that are presently adopted by billions of Muslims throughout the world.In this book, Allah, the Almighty, address the Prophet (bpuh) by saying; [And We have not sent you [O' Muhammad], except as a mercy to the world's.] (Qur'an 21:107)"

When his father was done with them, Ibrahim would use them as toys, riding on their backs, and kicking them at times. Then after a while, he would see these same statues in the temple, and people prostrating in front of them! Ibrahim asked his father: \"Why do you take these toys to the temple?\" His father said: \"They are statues that represent our gods. We worship them, we ask favors from them, and we offer them presents.\" Ibrahim's mind rejected this idea, and he felt a repulsion towards the idols.Language: English"

Further, how many Muslims today are aware of the rulings pertaining to their fast during Ramadhaan? This important book is a much-needed compilation of fataawa relating to the fast of Ramadhaan and other than it. It comprises 150 rulings passed by scholars of yester-year and those of today.

Shaykh Ibn Baaz mentions: Certainly, concerning the approach of the blessed month of Ramadhaan, I advise"

Allah also provided man divine guidance to fortify his intellect in this great task of controlling his desires which assures him tremendous blessings and favours he will gain if he places his desires under control and dominance.Al-Imam Ibn Qayyim discussed the human desires in a section of his book, Raodat al-Muhibbin (The Garden of Lovers), describing its meaning, usages, how the people get entangled in the web of desires, and most extensively, the means of getting released from the shackles of desires. This book is the translation of that section."

Through his deep reflection and knowledge of the Qur\u02be\u0101n and its related sciences, he provides insights into why its chapters are ordered so and unveils intricacies to the reader which could only have been unearthed by one possessing such mastery and genius. The author states at many junctures within the book that he is displaying his reflections to the reader, so one is given the opportunity through this intimate writing style to ponder over the Qur\u02be\u0101n from the perspective of a true tafs\u012br master. Qat\u0101dah (d. 118) said, \u201cBy Allah, they would find in the Qur\u02be\u0101n that which would impede sinfulness, if only they contemplated upon it and comprehended it.\u201d [Tafs\u012br al-\u1e6cabar\u012b] Al-Shawk\u0101n\u012b (d. 1250)"

In this book Shaykhul-Islaam defines the concept of worship in Islaam and explains that to be a true \u201cslave of Allaah\u201d is a status of both virtue and nobility. The author proves that the title \u201cslave of Allaah\u201d is one of great honour which Allaah bestowed on the best of creation, Muhammad (peace be on him). While elaborating on the issue of servitude, the author highlights the prevalent traps which people fall into, when becoming enslaved by, or allowing their hearts to become attached to worldly objects. The emphasis is on servitude to Allaah which is adorned with the true love we hold for Him in our hearts - a matter of central importance for every Muslim. Pages: 208 ISBN: 1"

        "description": "The Living Martyr - Talhah bin 'Ubaidullah\u00a0The Golden Series of the Prophet's Companionsby Abdul Basit AhmadTalhah bin 'Ubaidullah(rza) is one of the greatest heroes of Islam. All tribes inside and outside of Makkah knew how much he was chaste and pious. When he embraced Islam he was a promising shield that provided protection to so many weak and oppressed families to the extent that he was called by the Prophet(pbuh) - the example of benevolence. He was also given the glad tidings that he would be one of the martyrs and the Prophet's neighbor in Paradise. Thus we can say that this hero of Islam is the example to follow and join the eternal life of happiness."

Hence, if one has the ability to do it and it is easy for him, then in order that one may be good to the Muslims and safeguard the chastity of the many young ladies, this is better.

Abundant knowledge has been gathered and preserved and passed down the centuries through him. It is enough of a testimony to appreciate the status of Al-Hasan than the words of the famous Companion, Abdullah ibn 'Umar al-Khattab who said, \"Had the Prophet Peace and blessing be upon him, met Al-Hasan, he would have been pleased with him.\" Every work written on the character of Al-Hasan attests to"

The Iranians had 240,000 troops, but the Muslims with about 30,000 soldiers still drove the Iranian Empire, one of the superpowers of the day, into the ground.At Al-Qadisiyyah, the Muslims were able to break the Persian might, dealing them a blow from which they would never recover. The Battle of Al-Qadisiyyah is therefore one of the most decisive battles in the history of humanity."

Ibn Taymiyyah wrote many books, often under the most difficult of circumstances, that describe the path of the salaf and discuss the arguments of Muslim philosophers and of the Baatini and Raafidi groups, pointing out the flaws therein.

He reviews the history of freedom of opinion in the West and compares that with how Islam approaches the issue. He examines the arguments in favor of unrestricted freedom of expression in light of some actual consequences.Sheikh \u00e6Abdus-Salam al-Basuni demonstrates that the freedom to express one\u00c6s opinion is a fundamental right that is respected and protected by Islamic law. He argues that this right is embedded in the laws and principles of Islam, and shows how crucial limitations placed upon freedom of opinion work to protect the rights of individuals, their privacy and their honor, as well as to preserve the sanctity of human life and the security of human societies."

        "description": "The Hijab Liberation or Oppression?\u00a0 In the twenty-first century, the obligation of wearing the hijab is being questioned, and indeed, the freedom of Muslim women to wear the hijab is under threat in many countries. In this useful resource boob, Dr. Gohar Mushtaq comprehensively explains the benefits of wearing the hijab, citing evidence from both Islamic sources and scientific research. The author also expertly analyses fascinating research to highlight the little-known wisdom behind the institution of the hijab.

Muslims and non-Muslims alike will glean new insights into the hijab, which generates so much controversy in some circles. \u201cThis is a much needed book at a time and age when eyes are dazzled by modernity, where modesty"

In these often difficult times, we find many Muslims returning to their Din and embracing it with vigour and enthusiasm. However the astute observer will find that there are many problems that hinder its progress, problems that have caused some of the scholars to lay down some guidelines that the youth of this blessed awakening should adhere to and follow. It should also be noted that if the Islamic guidelines are not strictly adhered to, and the youth are left to be driven by their emotions alone, then surely this awakening will"

Once they begin to observe the requirements of Hijab, it may be that a sister has been obliged to wear the Hijab without truly pondering over its superiority. Perhaps she has reached the age of puberty and her parents have instructed her to wear it. Perhaps she has recently accepted Islam and her close companions have told her of its obligation. Alternatively, perhaps her husband has commanded her to wear Hijab. A sister who does not truly know the superiority of Hijab will always remain envious of disbelieving women. Why? Because they observe these misguided disbelievers attempting to look beautiful for all to see. Hence, the Muslim woman then compares herself to that woman which causes her to feel ashamed of her"

However the author very clearly suggests that we aught to look towards our own sins first, since calamities befall us as a result of them.

Such societies have existed in the past, in the golden eras of Islamic civilization, and we have the hope that, if Allah wills, such a society may appear again. In The Ideal Muslim Society, Dr. Muhammad \u2018Ali al-Hashimi gives us a detailed picture of what this society would look like. Drawing on his extensive research of Islamic history and contrasting the ideal with the sorry state of affairs in human societies today, he explores the religious, political, economic, social and other facets of this ideal society, illustrating everything from the responsibilities of those in authority to the interactions between individuals on the humblest levels."

When the heart is humble, so too is the hearing, seeing, head, and face; indeed all the limbs and their actions are humbled, even speech. This is why the Prophet would say in his bowing (ruku), \u201cMy hearing, sight, bones, and marrow are humbled to You,\u201d another narration has, \u201cand whatever my foot carries.\u201d One of the Salaf saw a man fidgeting in his prayer and remarked, \u2018If the heart of this person was humble, so too would his limbs be.\u2019 The source of the Khushu`, that takes place in the heart is the gnosis of allah\u2019s greatness, magnificence, and perfection."

        "description": "In this age of materialism, consumerism and extreme liberalism, the Muslim often finds himself at a loss, at odds to the ebb and flow of society, and holding to values, divinely revealed, that contrast starkly with the values held by many around him. He or she is looked at askance, accused of being backward, non-conformist and refusing to integrate. In the face of peer pressure, the resolve of some may weaken, the result being a watering-down of one's adherance to Islam and the values it calls to. The Prophet warned us that a time would come in which Islam and the Muslims would be beheld as strangers, not just by non-Muslims but by many Muslims as well! He informed us that days were coming in which trying to keep hold of one's religion would be like holding red hot coals,"

It requires the Muslim to learn his religion, discipline his soul and refine his conduct. The Muslim must have firm faith that everything that happens to him in this life is good for him, that his Lord would never decree anything that would be detrimental and, as such, he is required to be patient and steadfast in the face of adversity and grateful at times of ease. In this treatise, the author, ibn Rajab sets out to explain the advice the Prophet (SAW) imparted to ibn Abbas (radiyAllahu'anhuma), \"Safeguard Allah and He will safeguard you. Safeguard Allah and you will find Him in front of you. Know Allah in times of ease and He"

Salah al-Din, the great leader of the counter-crusade, had to wait twenty years before he could enter Jerusalem in 1187 CE and install the minbar of Nur al-Din Zangi in the Al-Aqsa Mosque. And eight hundred years later, Dar al-Islam had to wait almost forty years for a new minbar to replace the original one destroyed by vandalism.

        "description": "Sheikh Raslaan said: \u201cThe entire religion is comprised of worship, and the original meaning of worship is humility. Worship is [also] referred to as a pathway because it is paved by footsteps constantly crossing it. Therefore, worship can be understood as the commandments of All\u00e2h upon His servants which include the highest level of humility and love for All\u00e2h the Exalted. The great Sheikh Ibn Qayyim - [may All\u00e2h have mercy on him]-, said in his book An-Nooniyah: \u201cAnd the worship of the Most Merciful [All\u00e2h] is the highest level of love for Him, combined with the servant\u2019s humility. Both of them are its axis. And upon these two [axes], worship revolves, and worship will not revolve, until these two [love and humility] are established. And they depend upon the command of His [All\u00e2h\u2019s] Messenger and not upon desires, whims"

And if you neglect these vessels, someone else will fill them. It is upon the Muslim fathers to fear Allah the Exalted and to fill the hearts and minds of their children with the sirah of the Prophet and the seerah of his Companions, so they can take them as their role models."

Ever since the dawn of human life on this planet, Man has always sought to understand Nature, his own place in the scheme of Creation and the purpose of Life itself. In this quest for Truth, spanning many centuries and diverse civilizations, organized religion has shaped human life and determined to a large extent, the course of history. While some religions have been based on books, claimed by their adherents to be divinely inspired, others have relied solely on human experience. Al-Qur'an, the main source of the Islamic faith, is a book believed by Muslims, to be of completely Divine origin. Muslims also believe that it contains Divine guidance for all humankind. Since the message of the Qur'an is believed to be for all times, it should be relevant to every age."

They were a nation that took great pride in its natural talent of beautiful expression. Numerous were their poets, despite the fact that they were largely unlettered. They rated fine expression as the top talent anyone could have. Therefore, a poet was given a high status in his tribe and he returned that favour by continuously singing his tribe\u2019s praises. All this changed when the Qur\u2019an was recited to them by Muhammad, the\u00a0final messenger God sent to mankind. They recognised its great superiority to\u00a0anything they had experienced. They realised that it was totally different from\u00a0poetry, but they could not compare it to any style of expression they knew.

        "description": "By challenging the discursive scholarly tradition, and attempting to return to another type of tradition (i.e., the early generations of Muslims) Ibn Taymiyya carved a niche in Islamic intellectual history as a thinker who worked outside of the standard genre of running Qur\u2019an commentaries and redefined what exegesis should be.\u00a0 He argued that legitimate interpretation of the Qur\u2019an should rely on intra-textual relations within the Qur\u2019an, reports of the Prophet Muhammad, and reports of the early Muslims, the Salaf. My dissertation suggests that although Ibn Taymiyya\u2019s Muqaddima Fi Usul al-Tafsir (Treatise on the Principles of Qur\u2019anic Interpretation) articulates a system for performing qur\u2019anic exegesis, it proves difficult to find a definitive method that he consistently employs in his exegetical writings.

Due to this cause, the last part of the night is Sahr because it is cloaked and shrouded in darkness. Therefore, everything whose influence is subtle and shrouded from people can linguistically be referred to as Sihr. For instance, the Messenger of Allaah (r) said: \u201c...Some eloquent speech is effective as magic.\u201d This suggests that eloquent speech can leave an impression upon the soul and have an effect on it just as sorcery can have an effect on it; except that eloquence is not forbidden. Nameemah, which is the manner of spreading talk between people with the objective to deliberately induce corruption and tribulation, is also called Sihr.

The correct belief regarding Jesus as confirmed in the Qur\u2019an and Prophet Muhammad\u2019s teachings is that he was no more than a prophet and messenger of God sent with the same message as all the prophets before him such as Moses, Abraham and Noah.

They are not tainted with any doubt or uncertainty. The Arabic word \u2018aqeedah stems from the root \u2018aqada, which conveys meanings of certainty, affirmation, confirmation, etc. In the Qur\u2019aan, Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): \"Allaah will not punish you for what is unintentional in your oaths, but He will punish you for your deliberate oaths (bimaa \u2018aqqadtum al-aymaan)\u2026\" [al-Maa\u2019idah 5:87] The verb paraphrased here as \"deliberate oaths\" is \u2018aqqada/ta\u2019qeed, which refers to when one has determination in the heart. It may be said in Arabic, \u2018aqada\u2019l-habl (the rope was tied), i.e., it was pulled tight together. The word i\u2019tiqaad (belief) is also derived from this root, and has the meaning of tying up and making strong."

This treatise is essentially a gathering of powerful and insightful narrations (of the Companions, pious predecessors, and the Prophet Musa) that emphasise the importance of travelling and exerting efforts towards seeking knowledge. It also serves as a historical record, highlighting the efforts of the early generations of scholars without whom the knowledge would not have been collected.

So the best way to fight procrastination is to take immediate steps to do the thing one is postponing. So every time one is tempted to procrastinate, one must do whatever it takes to do just the opposite."

He synthesizes the concept of tolerance and al-wal\u00e2 wal-bar\u00e2 (loving and hating for the sake of Allah). Finally, he responds to the infamous \u2018Clash of Civilizations\u2019 thesis by arguing that Islam offers the solutions to some of the world\u2019s greatest problems. This short book examines the concept of tolerance in Islam. The Arabic word that is translated in English as \u2018tolerance\u2019 actually encompasses a much richer meaning than the idea of putting up with something grudgingly. It conveys a reciprocal sense of generosity, forgiveness, ease and smoothness.After discussing the nature of international relations from an Islamic perspective, Dr. Al Luhaidan goes"

His rule was exemplary, every decision and action of his being guided by the word of Allah, as enshrined in the Quran. It is difficult to imagine that any ruler who had a huge empire, like Umar Farooq's(ra), would live like a simple, common man. But that is exactly what he did. He wore clothes with many patches, slept on the floor, ate plain food and travelled to foreign lands with just one servant and a camel. Umar Farooq (ra) had a strong sense of duty and justice. Throughout his rule, everyone was treated equally and with justice, whether he was a Muslim or a non-Muslim. He lived in the love and fear of Allah. In the history of the"

People often see, and hear of, the believers being afflicted with adversity and tribulation, and conversely they often see, and hear of the disbelievers attaining leadership and wealth in this world. This leads them to mistakenly believe that well-being in this world is only reserved for the disbelievers. A believer may face many trials and tribulations that test his faith, patience and endurance. In a world full of conflict and war, with many also suffering from personal and family problems, shaytan causes a person to question many things. If a Muslim is tried with a difficulty, then the reasons for this are many - including one's own sin, which arise from leaving something obligated"

This account of how Uthm\u00e2n ibn Aff\u00e2n, the third Rightly-Guided Caliph, expanded the Islamic state, compiled the Qur\u2019an into a single edition, and, finally, dealt with the turmoil that engulfed the Ummah, makes for a very enlightening read.

Based upon this, the Angel Jibril (peace be upon him) said to Maryam\u2014it is said it is from the speech of \u02bf\u012as\u0101, \u201cAnd if you see any human being, say: \u2018Verily! I have vowed a fast unto the Most Beneficent (All\u0101h), so I shall not speak to any human being this day.\u201d [S\u016brah Maryman 19:26] The meaning of the statement, \u2018fast\u2019 refers to refrain from talking. Hence, fasting linguistically means to refrain from doing something. Its Isl\u0101mic definition is to refrain from food, drink, and sexual desires from the time of the second Fajr (i.e., true Fajr) until the setting of the Sun. At the beginning of Isl\u0101m, the person was allowed to break his fast."

Unfortunately, it is also a sad state of affairs that today one must also go beyond the picture that the Muslims themselves give non-Muslims of Islam.

Although the treatise is short, it nonetheless contains much benefit and lessons and illustrates Ibn Taymiyyah's psychological disposition which strengthened him during his trials and tribulations, and furthermore allowed him to find peace and contentment in situations where most would only fall into despair and depression. Perhaps it will direct us similarly when we face inevitable times of hardship and difficulty.32 PagesP/BA5"

In it, he explains how love is the basis of every movement that occurs in the universe and every action of Bani \u0100dam.

In the surahs covered in this book, we find Al-Anfal and At-Tawbah, two Madini surahs that mark major milestones in the post-Hijrah conflict between believers and disbelievers. We then move onto a long series of Makki surahs. From Yunus to Al-Kahf, the author helps her readers to appreciate both the similarities and the uniqueness in their messages.

        "description": "Ibn Rushd's \"Bidayat al-Mujtahid\" (\"The Distinguished Jurist's Primer\") occupies a unique place among the authoritative manuals of Islamic law. It is designed to prepare the jurist for the task of the mujtahid, the independent jurist, who derives the law and lays down precedents to be followed by the judge in the administration of justice. In this manual Ibn Rushd traces most of the issues of Islamic law, describing not only what the law is, but also elaborating the methodology of some of the greatest legal minds in Islam to show how such laws were derived. This text provides a still-relevant basis for the interpretation and formulation of Islamic law. Combining his legal and philosophical knowledge, Ibn Rushd transcends the boundaries of different schools and presents a critical analysis of the opinions of the famous Muslim jurists and their methodologies.

M H Kamali sets out the proclamations on human dignity found in the Qur'an and then discusses topics pertaining to or resulting from human dignity: the physical and spiritual nobility of man; God's love for humanity; the sanctity of life; and the necessity for freedom, equality and accountability. Finally, the author examines the measures that the Shariah has taken to protect human dignity and to promote it in social interaction. The discussion is here presented in the light of the debate on the universality of human rights as enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. This book goes a long way towards exploring an alternative to Western concepts of human rights. 134pp"

Out of nowhere, he comment-ed, \"I think Muslims are good, but Islam is evil!\" Taken aback by this Fox News style rhetoric, I responded, \"Well, first of all thanks for the compliment about Muslims, but why do you think Islam is bad?\" He replied, \"Because your holy book calls me an animal.\" In"

And those who spend the night in worship of their Lord, prostrating and standing in prayer.

They go out in the morning with their stomachs empty and return filled in the evening.\u201d (Tirmidhee)This book discusses the place of pride Islam gives to making lawful earnings and rizq through hard work and striving. It also looks at the contempt Islam places on begging and indolence. Then it looks at which earnings are lawful, which are not and the many ways by which wealth can increase while seeking the pleasure of Allah (Glorified and Exalted is He).101 PagesP/BA5"

Little Explorers Magazine is a pioneering effort in a vast educational realm in which precious little has been done over the past three decades. The limited amount of specially designed books, magazines, DVDs, toys, computer games, etc., on the market indicates a general lack of awareness prevalent in the Muslim English-speaking world. As a result, Muslim children today, continue to be forced to fulfil their recreational and educational intellectual needs from non-Muslim sources which usually come fully laden with un-Islamic cultural baggage.This issue focuses on generating the reader\u2019s historical, practical and overall knowledge about Hajj in a fun and innovative way.21 pages"

This classic manuscript begins with the courageous stance of the Abyssinian king an-Naj\u0101shi, which shook Heraclius of Rome, defied the tribes of Makkah while influencing the kings of Oman, and even softened the hearts of Prophet Muh\u0323ammad\u2019s staunchest adversaries. The second part recounts two waves of da\u2019wah in Africa: the Arab merchants and the S\u0323\u016bfis, both of which left a lasting imprint upon the continent. The third part details the scholars who led the revival of the Salafi da\u2019wah in Africa and advises the students of knowledge about the future of Isl\u0101m in Africa.

        "description": "Publisher's NoteIslam stresses much about acquiring the good character. Many Verses and Ahaadith give the Muslims the direction that they should always try to present their good character before others whether they may be Muslims or non-Muslims.We find in the teachings that we have to acquire good character in all walks of our life. We are to acquire that whether we are worshipping Allah or praying for the blessings of Allah upon the Prophet or while we are with the parents or we are behaving with the neighbors and relatives or we are with our friends and elders or young than us.These good traits should be taught to our new generation, with this purpose in mind we have published this book to help the parents taught their children good character."

Additionally, this practice\u00a0will ward off any boredom one may feel due to\u00a0repeating the same adhkar, as well as, reviving any\u00a0invocations that may have been forgotten leading some\u00a0people to deny [the availability of] such invocations,\u00a0due to their lack of use.

This is an important lesson for leaders at all levels and all times. Sometimes, it is essential to yield graciously and give up positions of status and authority for the greater good of the Ummah. By giving up the caliphate to Muawiyyah, al-Hasan (may Allah be pleased with him) clearly demonstrated that the differences among the Muslims were purely political.

Lack of this matter will certainly lead to coming out of the fold of Islam.Unfortunately, the majority of Muslims nowadays follow and imitate disbelievers in customs, rituals and traditions which are against the teachings of Islam. It will be useful if they follow them in the field of technology and science.This book sheds light on this topic to implant the spirit of joining and supporting the believers and warns them against the bad consequences of copying the same style of life of disbelievers.We hope that Muslims will get benefited from it and adopt the necessary measures to act upon the orders of our religion."

It is amazing that such a slim volume can contain such diverse insights, ranging from why Allah used particular names when He introduced Himself to Musa 'alayhi salam, to the purpose of power and the characteristics of male and female rulers in the Qur'an.

Women in Islam are; mothers, sisters, partners, workers, scholars and business owners and managers. etc. Though this book outlines the ideal Muslimah personality as it should be according to the Qur'an and Sunnah Husbands, sons and daughters will also draw very much benefit from it.

Folk stories abound, and many superstitious practices have arisen in Muslim cultures with regard to protection against the jinn. Many myths surround the ideas of the evil eye and envy, and there are many strange notions surrounding illnesses such as epilepsy and mental illness, which are often thought of as being caused by the jinn. This book cuts through all the confusion and identifies correct Islamic teachings on all these subjects. The jinn are real and they can indeed harm humans, but this book will teach you how to protect yourself in the manner taught by the Prophet (saw). Break free from fear, superstition and fairy stories, and familiarize yourself with the teachings of Islam on these important aspects of spirituality which the author presents here,"

From the shaykh's many enlightening statements on this extraordinary subject are: \"The minds stirred in those who have intellects, but they were not able to perceive the soul. The people spoke of its reality, but they could not prove what they said. They sought means to understand it, but they did not know the way.\" \"I only singled out this subject because speech concerning the soul is a very noble topic. And how could this not be the case when it has been narrated, Whoever knows himself, knows his Lord.''"
